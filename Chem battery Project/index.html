                            <p>Created by Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta the voltaic pile was the first chemical
                                battery. A voltaic pile consists of copper ( cathode ) and zinc ( anode ) disks
                                separated by a cloth dipped in brine (a salt solution).

                                Cu<sup>+2</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> -> Cu(s)<br /><br />

                                The net cell reaction is:<br />
                                Zn(s) + Cu<sup>+2</sup>(aq) -> Zn<sup>+2</sup>(aq) + Cu(s)<br />
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you were to connect a piece of zinc and copper without an electrolyte the current
                                would flow momentarily. After a few moments, however electrons would build up at the
                                cathode (copper plate) preventing any further flow of electrons. In textbooks, the
                                electrode and electrolyte are often the same element for ease of comprehension.
                                Fortunately you don't need the same elements as long as a reaction occurs. In the
                                absence of a salt bridge the voltaic pile uses a cloth dipped in brine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the negatively charged chlorine ions gives up an electron to the positively
                                charged zinc. The neutral chlorine atom then bonds with another neutral chlorine atom
                                turning into chlorine gas and evaporating.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although the most obvious next reaction would be the sodium gaining an electron from the
                                negatively charged copper this is not the case. Sodium’s low electronegativity means
                                that there is not enough energy for it to gain another electron. Instead the water
                                molecules on the surface of the copper react. The water molecule accepts an electron
                                from the copper producing hydroxide and a hydrogen atom. The hydroxide remains inside
                                the solution while the hydrogen bonds with another neutral hydrogen forming hydrogen gas
                                and evaporating. Now the electron buildup is overcome and electrons can continue to
                                flow.

                                With the introduction of the Daniell cell came visions of batteries’ practical use.
                                Improving upon many of the voltaic pile’s flaws the Daniell cell saw popularity in
                                telegraph networks. The battery was so impressive that the electromotive force of the
                                Daniell cell was used to define the volt ( with later definitions specifying
                                electromotive force at 25° the cell now produces 1.10V ).

                                A Daniell Cell consists of a large copper cylinder (anode) filled with a copper sulphate
                                solution. In order to maintain the concentration of the copper sulphate solution copper
                                sulphate crystals are placed at the bottom of the copper cylinder Inside the copper
                                cylinder is a porous pot filled with a sulphuric acid solution. Finally a zinc rod
                                (cathode) is placed inside the porous pot.
                            </p>

                                The reaction starts with the negatively charged sulphate ions inside the porous pot.
                                The negative sulphate ions react with the zinc rod creating zinc sulphate. The zinc rod
                                attains a negative charge with the excess of electrons created by the production of zinc
                                sulphate. On the other hand the hydrogen ions move to the copper vessel. The free ions
                                of the copper then neutralise the hydrogen ions to form hydrogen atoms. The copper
                                cylinder (anode) becomes positively charged due to a deficiency of electrons. Finally
                                the hydrogen atoms react with the copper sulphate solution to form sulphuric acid.

                                The first lead-acid battery was invented in 1859 by Gaston Planté. Lead-acid batteries
                                were revolutionary because they were the first to be rechargeable. This battery does not
                                come without severe drawbacks. It has a very low energy to weight ratio and a low energy
                                to volume ratio. It does however have a high power to weight ratio making it an
                                attractive choice for use in starter motors. This inexpensive but specialised battery
                                dominated the
                                battery market, accounting for 45% of all battery sales in 1999.

                                Lead-acid batteries are relatively simple. They consist of one lead cathode and another
                                lead(IV) oxide anode. The cathode and anode are put inside a container filled with
                                sulphuric acid. As the pure lead cathode discharges it bonds with a sulphate ion
                                creating lead sulphate. As lead(IV) oxide cathode receives electrons it reacts with the
                                sulphuric acid and the hydrogen to create lead sulphate and water.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because of the nature of their chemistry a lead acid battery has a lead cathode and
                                lead(IV) oxide anode when it is charged. When the battery is discharged it has two lead
                                sulphate rods and a less concentrated sulphuric acid solution. Measuring the
                                concentration of the sulphuric acid solution allows the battery level to be determined.

                                Lithium ion batteries see a large majority presence in electronics, vehicles, and
                                aerospace technology. They are popular in these categories because they are rechargeable
                                and have a high energy to volume, and energy to weight ratio. Pure lithium is extremely
                                reactive, which is why lithium-ion batteries don’t use pure lithium. Instead,
                                lithium-ion batteries contain a lithium-metal oxide, such as lithium-cobalt oxide.

                                Lithium ion batteries advance our understanding of batteries taking on a completely new
                                structure. In place of a container with electrodes lithium ion batteries resemble a
                                series of sheets.

                                A lithium ion battery consists of three main sheets. The first being a copper sheet
                                (anode) and the second being an organic salt of lithium as the electrolyte. The third
                                sheet is an aluminum sheet (cathode). A lithium metal oxide is pasted to the cathode and
                                graphite is pasted to the anode. To charge the battery a power source is connected to
                                the battery. The electrons are pulled away from the lithium atoms and into the cathode.
                                The lithium ions are attracted to the anode and rest in between graphite layers. Once
                                all the lithium ions are stored in the graphite, the battery is fully charged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the power source is removed and a load is connected to the batteries the lithium
                                ions will want to return to their stable state. The lithium ions return to the metal
                                oxide and the electrons return through the wires connecting the cathode and anode. Once
                                all the lithium ions have returned to the metal oxide the battery is depleted.

                                Over Discharging supersaturated lithium cobalt oxide, leads to the production of lithium

                                Overcharging up to 5.2 volts leads to the synthesis of cobalt(IV) oxide:<br />
